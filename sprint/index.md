# Sprint

The team at PyMC is organizing an open source sprint in collaboration with Data Umbrella, an organization for underrepresented persons in data science. This sprint will take place in two slots of two hours each to accommodate as many time zones as we can. If you’re a prospective participant do know that there will be at least two members of the PyMC team present throughout the sprint on discord and zoom to help you out. Additionally, there’s a ton of resources to help you get started and prepare beforehand other than the webinars we're conducting, you can find them here:

## Sprint - Goals
In this sprint we’re focusing on bringing in new contributors, we sincerely hope this will be a welcoming, inclusive experience for you into the world of open source software. We hope to help you to the best of our abilities and learn from you as well!
The sprint will consist of small resolvable issues and contributing to the PyMC documentation, so if you aren’t experienced in software development no worries at all, you can contribute to documentation with knowledge of markdown or statistics. 
Here’s the fun part, we’ll be giving away stickers, mugs and the Bayesian Computation book by PyMC Developers Ravin, Junpeng and Osvaldo!!! Find the schedule and all other details on pymc-data-umbrella.xyz

## Sprint - Requirements

- working knowledge of some programming language (preferably python, if not, no worries! you can attend a pre main event session to get some familiarity with python, it will be accessible as long as you know at least one language)

- get your laptop, and some stable internet connection!

- familiarity with basic statistics (i.e. high school / sophomore undergrad level stats courses, you don’t need to know a lot, we’ll explain the basics real quick!)

## Sprint - Target Audience

* Current working professionals in data science/software engineering
* People with a statistical background
* Someone who has already contributed to open source
* Students or anyone in the community who is completely new to open source but wants to try!
